      How often the expvar-forwarder should scrape registered

        A array of Objects that have the following fields:
        - addr: address of the expvar endpoint
        - name: The output name of the Counter
        - source_id: The output sourceID of the Counter
        - template: The golang text/template to find the metric in the expvar
          output.
        - tags: An object that can only have string values. They will be
          passed as tags on the envelope.

          such as the jsonMap)

          passed as tags on the envelope.
        Each entry in the map will be parsed into one gauge per key before it
        is forwarder onto the receiving log cache instance.
